        <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
            Math anxiety—negative feelings toward math—is hypothesized to be associated with the avoidance of
            math-related activities such as taking math courses and pursuing STEM careers. However, there is little
            experimental evidence for the math anxiety-avoidance link. Such evidence is important for formulating how to
            break this relationship. We hypothesize that math avoidance emerges when one perceives the costs of
            effortful math engagement to outweigh its benefits and that this perception depends on individual
            differences in math anxiety. To test this hypothesis, we developed an effort-based decision-making task in
            which participants chose between solving easy, low-reward problems and hard, high-reward problems in both
            math and nonmath contexts. Higher levels of math anxiety were associated with a tendency to select easier,
            low-reward problems over harder, high-reward math (but not word) problems. Addressing this robust math
            anxiety-avoidance link has the potential to increase interest and success in STEM fields.</p>
