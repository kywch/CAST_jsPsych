    <p><br><span style="font-size: 20px;">In each trial of the choose-and-solve task, you will be provided two options; solve either an easy problem with low reward or solve a hard problem with high reward. In easy problems, we expect that you will get more than 90% correct. In hard problems, the difficulty is adaptive to your competence, so that you will perform at about 70% correct for both word and math problems. You should choose what type of problem you want to solve <strong>within 3 seconds</strong>, otherwise you will be directed to the easy problem. Then, you will be presented with a problem of your choice, which you have to solve <strong>within 7 seconds</strong>. You will earn the points if you get the problem correct.</span></p>

    <p><br><span style="font-size: 20px;">The choose-and-solve task consists of practice word and math problems, choice-making practice, and five main blocks of 28 trials each, i.e., 140 main trials. <strong>The points you earned in the main blocks will be converted into cash bonus at the exchange rate of 1₵/point.</strong> The maximum point you can earn from those blocks is 540, so the maximum bonus on top of the base compensation ($2.00) are $7.40. For example, if you score 400 points, your total compensation will be $6.00. </span>
        <em
            style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>So, maximize your earnings by maximizing your points! </strong></em>
